# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in improving this project! 🎉

## How to contribute

1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature
   ```
2. Make your changes (docs, UI, notebooks, etc.)
3. Run local checks
   - UI: `npm --prefix ./ui run build`
   - Notebooks: open and run the modified notebook cells
4. Commit with a clear message
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: short description of change"
   ```
5. Push and open a Pull Request against `main`

## Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused and small when possible
- Prefer PyTorch for new notebook examples
- For UI changes, include a screenshot or short note of the change
- Update README/docs when behavior or structure changes

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful and collaborative. We welcome contributions from learners at all levels. If you encounter an issue with behavior, open an issue and we’ll address it promptly.
