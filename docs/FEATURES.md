# Project Features

A quick tour of the capabilities provided by this repository and UI.

## UI (React + Vite + Tailwind)

- Modern, responsive design with tasteful 3D transforms and gradient accents
- Light/Dark theme toggle stored in localStorage
- Clean navigation: Syllabus, Practicals, Assignments
- Build-time optimized (Vite), ready for GitHub Pages deployment
- SPA-friendly with `404.html` fallback

## Learning content

- Unit-wise notes enriched with key concepts, equations, and lab checklists
- Jupyter notebooks (P1–P5) with runnable PyTorch code cells
- Practical output summaries to set expectations
- Unit-wise assignment sheets with theory + hands-on tasks

## Tooling & DevEx

- NPM scripts for development and production builds
- Helper scripts: `run-ui.ps1`, `run-ui.bat`
- GitHub Actions: build CI and Pages deployment

## Roadmap ideas

- Add interactive examples in the UI (e.g., small demos for activation functions)
- Code quality: linting/formatting and pre-commit hooks
- Add Python notebooks test harness (smoke execution)
- Expand datasets guidance and add more references
