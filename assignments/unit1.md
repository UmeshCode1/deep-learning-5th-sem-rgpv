# Unit 1 Assignment — Introduction, MLPs, PCA

Total Marks: 50 | Due: Two weeks from assignment date

A. Short Answers (10 marks)
1. Define perceptron and derive its decision boundary.
2. Explain bias–variance tradeoff with a simple diagram.
3. State PCA objective and explain eigenvalues/eigenvectors.

B. Problems (20 marks)
1. Implement a 2-layer MLP (hidden=64) on the sklearn digits dataset. Report train/test accuracy and plot loss curve for 20 epochs.
2. Perform PCA on digits (64 dims). Plot explained variance ratio and reconstruct a sample with k={8, 16, 32}.

C. Application/Analysis (15 marks)
1. Compare PCA + Logistic Regression vs. raw pixels + Logistic Regression. Discuss results.

D. Viva (5 marks)
- Prepare 3 conceptual questions you found tricky and your answers.

Deliverables
- Notebook (.ipynb) or .py + report.pdf with plots and discussion
- Include figures: loss curve, confusion matrix, PCA variance, reconstructions
