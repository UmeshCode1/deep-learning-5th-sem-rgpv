# Unit 3 Assignment — CNNs & Architectures

Total Marks: 50 | Due: Two weeks from assignment date

A. Short Answers (10 marks)
1. Define receptive field. How does it change with kernel size/stride/pooling?
2. Explain depthwise separable convolutions and their benefits.

B. Problems (20 marks)
1. Train a small CNN on CIFAR-10 (3 Conv blocks + FC). Report accuracy, confusion matrix, and 10 misclassified images.
2. Re-implement VGG-style network with fewer parameters; compare performance vs. baseline CNN.

C. Application/Analysis (15 marks)
1. Use Grad-CAM on 5 images. Discuss what the model focuses on.

D. Viva (5 marks)
- Be ready to explain batch norm and its training vs. inference behavior.

Deliverables
- Notebook + report with metrics, plots, Grad-CAM visualizations
