# Unit 2 Assignment — Optimization & Autoencoders

Total Marks: 50 | Due: Two weeks from assignment date

A. Short Answers (10 marks)
1. Distinguish SGD, Momentum, RMSProp, Adam with update equations.
2. Explain vanishing gradients and two mitigation strategies.

B. Problems (20 marks)
1. Train a denoising autoencoder on MNIST: encoder(784→128), decoder(128→784), MSE loss. Add 30% salt-n-pepper noise. Report PSNR for 20 test samples.
2. Compare Adam vs. SGD+Momentum for the same network; plot validation loss.

C. Application/Analysis (15 marks)
1. Show feature visualizations from the encoder (TSNE/UMAP allowed). Interpret clusters.

D. Viva (5 marks)
- Prepare 3 conceptual questions with brief answers.

Deliverables
- Notebook/report with plots, training curves, denoised outputs, and analysis
