# Unit 5 Assignment — Generative Models & GANs

Total Marks: 50 | Due: Two weeks from assignment date

A. Short Answers (10 marks)
1. Contrast VAEs and GANs in terms of objective and training stability.
2. Explain mode collapse and two remedies.

B. Problems (20 marks)
1. Train a DCGAN on MNIST for 5 epochs. Log generator/discriminator losses and show 16 generated samples.
2. Implement a conditional GAN (cGAN) to generate digits conditioned on labels; compare sample quality.

C. Application/Analysis (15 marks)
1. Evaluate FID (or a proxy like KID) for your models; discuss limitations of image quality metrics.

D. Viva (5 marks)
- Prepare a concise explanation of KL vs. JS divergence used in generative modeling.

Deliverables
- Notebook + report with generated grids, loss curves, and metric discussion
