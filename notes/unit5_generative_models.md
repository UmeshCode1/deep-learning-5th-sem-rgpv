# Unit V — Generative Models

## Topics
- Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) and Deep Belief Networks (DBNs)
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and variants
- Evaluation metrics for generative models
- Applications: Image synthesis, data augmentation

## Learning Outcomes
- Understand and implement GANs and RBMs at a conceptual level.
- Evaluate generative outputs and common pitfalls (mode collapse, instability).

## Suggested Reading
- Goodfellow et al., GAN original paper, DCGAN paper, WGAN.
